Hi👋, 

I'm Brandon Opere!

I’m the Founder and DevRel at TechOps Apex, where I combine hands-on product engineering with technical education and community building. I’m passionate about building tools, sharing knowledge, and helping developers unlock the full potential of modern technologies—especially in the fast-moving world of AI.

At the core of my work is a deep focus on AI developer tools. I actively work with platforms like OpenAI, Hugging Face, LangChain, Pinecone, and other cutting-edge frameworks in the AI/ML space. Whether it’s integrating LLMs into real-world products, fine-tuning models for performance, or building intuitive dev-facing APIs—I’m all about making AI more accessible and usable for developers.

As a Software & Product Engineer, I work across the stack to build scalable solutions using technologies like TypeScript, Python, Node.js, React, and Next.js, along with cloud services like Vercel, Firebase, and AWS. I approach product development with a strong focus on developer & user experience, performance, and impact.

In my DevRel and technical instructing roles, I create tutorials, live demos, docs, and developer guides—often centered around AI, open-source, and dev productivity. I’ve taught concepts ranging from prompt engineering to model deployment, helping developers go from zero to production with modern AI tools.

I'm also deeply involved in open-source, contributing to and maintaining projects that simplify complex workflows for engineers. Whether it’s speaking at events, mentoring devs, or writing technical content, my goal is always the same: to build useful things and help others do the same—faster and better.

Let’s connect if you’re building in AI, dev tooling, or just love great software.
